(Note : I continue to develope Profile screen and authentication screens for Google and Facebook sign. I will update the project.)

# NeYicez (Food Delivery App)
NeYicez is an Android application developed using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The project utilizes Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit with coroutines for network requests, Glide for image loading, and Firebase Authentication for user authentication.

## The Goal of the Project
Developing projects using architecture, technologies and libraries that I learned during the course.

## Architecture
The application architecture is based on the MVVM pattern, which separates the data presentation logic (Views or UI) from the core business logic of the application.

## Libraries
**- Retrofit ->** I used the Retrofit library to fetch data in JSON format from the web service and to update the data in the service. <br/>
**- Coroutines ->** I used the Coroutine library to perform requests to time-consuming services and receive responses in parallel threads without blocking the user interface.. <br/>
**- Glide ->** A fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework. <br/>
**- Firebase ->**  Authentication işlemi için Firebase Authentication kullandım. Sipariş ve favori ekranlarıma ait verileri saklamak için Firebase Firestore kullandım. Profil ekranında fotoğraf saklama işlemi  için  Firebase Storage'ı kullandım.
